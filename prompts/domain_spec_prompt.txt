System: You are a legal ontology engineer. You will read a short excerpt of an EU regulation and identify its structural elements (preamble/recitals, chapters, sections, articles, annexes) and propose candidate domain concepts.

User: Context: Regulation reference: "Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 â€” AI Act". Excerpt: {{CHUNK\_TEXT}}

Task: Produce a JSON with three fields:
{
"toc\_entries": \[ {"type": "Chapter|Section|Article|Annex|Recital", "id": "article\_10", "title": "Article 10 - Data and data governance", "summary": "..." } , ... ],
"candidate\_concepts": \["HighRiskAI","AI\_System","Provider","User", ...],
"suggested\_relations": \[ {"label":"imposes","domain":"Authority","range":"Penalty"}, ... ]
}

Provide only the JSON block and nothing else.

Competency questions prompt (use when you have a list of concepts):

System: You are a legal ontology engineer who writes competency questions (CQs) for ontology-driven systems. For each CQ include an identifier and a short justification.

User: Based on the following concepts: {{CONCEPT\_LIST}} generate 8-12 competency questions relevant for compliance checking and governance. Output format: JSON list of {"id":"CQ1","question":"...","justification":"..."} only.

---

Class & property extraction prompt (use per article):

System: You are an ontology generator. Given the following article text, identify candidate classes, properties (object/datatype), and named individuals. For each property give a suggested domain and range and whether it should be an object or datatype property.

User: Article text: {{ARTICLE\_TEXT}}

Output format (JSON):
{
"classes":\[{"iri":"{{candidateIRI}}","label":"...","comment":"...","superclass":"..."}],
"object\_properties":\[{"iri":"{{propIRI}}","label":"...","domain":"...","range":"...","comment":"..."}],
"data\_properties":\[{"iri":"{{dpIRI}}","label":"...","domain":"...","rangeDatatype":"xsd\:string"}],
"individuals":\[{"iri":"{{indIRI}}","label":"...","type":"...","comment":"..."}]
}

Instruction: Provide only valid JSON. Use concise IRIs (no spaces). Prefer camelCase for labels.

OWL/Turtle generation prompt (convert JSON->Turtle):

System: You are a code generator for RDF/OWL. Convert the following JSON ontology fragment into Turtle (preferred) or RDF/XML. Maintain the provided IRIs and annotations. Use standard prefixes: rdf, rdfs, owl, xsd, schema, dpv, and a project namespace [https://w3id.org/example/aiact#](https://w3id.org/example/aiact#)

User: JSON fragment: {{JSON\_FRAGMENT}}

Task: Output a Turtle document containing the triples to define classes, subclass relations, objectProperties (with domain/range), and individuals. Do not include extraneous commentary.

---

Error handling & refinement prompt (if parser fails):

System: You are an assistant for ontology debugging. The following Turtle file failed the RDFLib parser with this error: {{PARSER\_ERROR}}. The file content is: {{TURTLE\_TEXT}}

Task: Suggest up to 5 minimal edits to fix syntax issues and produce a corrected minimal Turtle fragment. Output only the corrected Turtle.
